            <h4>Coder Academy 2019</h4>
            <span>
                This full time course used dynamic teaching alongside individual and team project work to develop industry relevant technical skills such as Ruby on Rails, express.js, MongoDB and others.
                It also established key project skills such as wire framing, source control, TDD/BDD and more.

            <h3>Online Programming Courses</h3>
            <h4>Stackskills, Udemy, Zenva 2017-current</h4>
            <span>
                Beginning with 'The complete Python Bundle', these courses were the beginning of my passion for coding.
                They also offer a way to continue expanding on my studies.

            <h3>Diploma of Outdoor Recreation</h3>
            <h4>Avondale College 2010-2011</h4>
            <span>
                This course involved first learning, and then leading, dangerous outdoor activities like whitewater kayaking, rock climbing and others.
                Learning and being responsible for my own safety, as well as that of a whole group, quickly developed my leadership, risk management and
                problem solving skills.

                I worked and studied in the outdoors for around seven years after completing my schooling. That included:
            </span>
                <ul>
                    <li> A one year program in the Army, where I developed discipline and teamwork</li>
                    <li> Two years of study at Avondale College, for which I was awarded a partial scholarship due to schooling achievements</li>
                    <li> Over four years in the industry as an instructor, including a team management position, where I built skills in problem solving and leadership.</li>
                </ul>
            <span>
                During that time I was married and began considering a career change to better fit that change in lifestyle.
            </span>
            <span>
                I undertook self-directed study in programming and, after developing a love for it, was recently able to complete an intensive course in Web Development.
